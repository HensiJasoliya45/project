                    <p>vaccination is an important and effective health intervention for children. Over the course of history, it has helped keep millions of children protected against infectious and life-threatening diseases.</p>

                    <p>Vaccines have been so&nbsp;effective that some diseases that were once feared are now either eradicated or easily manageable. Yet, in the recent past many new diseases are emerging too. This makes vaccination of a child even more important.</p>
                    
                    <p>Vaccines are most effective when they are administered to children at the right age and with the recommended dosage as children are susceptible to certain diseases at certain ages. As an example, polio occurs most frequently in children below the age of 5. Because of this, polio vaccines are given to children of those ages to prevent harm caused by the disease. A child who isn't vaccinated or isn't vaccinated on time remains unprotected and has increased chances of getting seriously ill.</p>
